## Filename Extensions.
.h files => How do I use it is the intent.
	This contains @interface.
	Declares it to the world (declarations).
	Doesn't change much over time.


.m files => How does it work is its intent.
	Describes the guts of how stuff works.
	Often much longer than the header files.
	Changes often over development time.

The key with .h and .m is the separation of concerns => less cognitive load.

	#import "Chessboard.h"

We never import .m, but we import .h so that the main.m file knows the existance of chessboard.h

The header file does not include implementation details (from the .m file).
