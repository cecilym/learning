# CoreData

A way to store data locally (local parse). More heavyweight than ActiveRecord, so we have to do more setup.

Check Ned's Friend Finder for a [demo](https://github.com/ruggeri/FriendFinderDemo).

Two objects:
We're in the world of NSManagedObject. An entity is another word for a model/table. Objects are for rows.

1. NSManagedObjectContext. The context. It's responsible for storing everything in the database.

2. NSManagedObjectModel. Describes the schema. It knows what kind of data is in sqlite. We start here. 

The .xcdatamodeld is where we start off describing all of our models.

Each class is an entity. Each property is an attribute. Relationships between entitys are called relationships.
