This wiki and repo is an experiment in learning. 

Here's what you do:

In a subject you're learning about, start writing the book on it.
Whenever you learn a new concept, or finish a new project, write a small tutorial teaching someone else to do what you just did.


Here's a running file of ideas I'm keeping on learning. I reserve the right to be mistaken ;).

## Hard Learning
Here's a paradigm:
There are two types of learning: Easy learning and Hard learning.

Easy learning: Learning more history or biology.
Hard learning: Learning french, learning to play guitar.

Coding falls into the second part. Learning code is a lot more like learning how to play guitar (I'm a musician), than learning biology.

## Technical Learning
Here's a second paradigm:
There are two learning modes: technical learning, and creative learning.

Technical learning is playing guitar scales over and over for hours on end. 
There's an established proper way to do technical learning. Many of them are right.
Technical learning is mentally and physically taxing.

Creative learning is writing your own songs.
Creative learning has few 'proper' methodologies. Most aren't useful.
Creative learning is emotionally taxing.

Finding a balance between the two is essential to quickly building things people want. Experiment.
