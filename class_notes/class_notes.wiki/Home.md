How I learned code. This is a live document (it changes a lot). It's (hopefully) all in chronological order. 

# Learning To Code

## Ruby
Learn Ruby the hard way http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/
This was my first introduction to coding.

Test-first ruby http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby

Ruby Koans http://rubykoans.com/

http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/jstwitter.html
This was my first introduction to using apis.


Alternatively, you could go through,
http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/
I've only done a few tutorials from here, but they've all been really good.

### Rails
Hartl http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book
Hartl was my first introduction to the rails framework.

## Objective C
We're working through the Big Nerd Ranch on Objective C

http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/
The stanford class on iphone development is the best free open resource on iOS out there (better than the docs).

https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/chapters/Introduction.html
Some of the apple docs are actually tutorials/guides/walkthroughs that are really useful. Here's one for beginners that I looked through.

## Python
Learn Python the hard way is legit.

http://www.udacity.com/
This is even more legit. It's a really awesome lead-in to programming in general (in python here). It'll take you from "Here's the terminal" to "Here's how I program this self-driving car". Very legit.


## Javascript
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript
This is Mozilla's collection of javascript tutorials


http://www.codecademy.com/
These are also legit. These in-browser tuts are designed more for total beginners to programming. I've been flying through a lot of it, but learning the syntax is good.

(I'm learning javascript outside of the class, mostly to contribute to/work at khan academy).

Here's a few cool javascript frameworks that I need to get on top of:
	1. jQuery
	2. Backbone.js
	3. Ember.js

# Tools

## The Internet
Coursera saas course. https://class.coursera.org/saas/auth/welcome

## The Command Line
Command line interface crash course. http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/
I spend a lot of time in the command line. It's a good thing to know my way around using it.

## Git
For a long time, I just used github's tutorials on working with git. 
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git

https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo

https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo

https://help.github.com/articles/be-social
The first two chapters of the git pro book, along with these tutorials, have been enough git for me.

## Algorithms

Ned Ruggeri taught me algorithms. I took some notes that you can check out here.

How to build a lean startup


## Tips
1. Working with other developers will make you a better coder.
2. Coding everyday will make you a better coder.
3. Building things > reading + copying


### TODO (For Me)
1. Learn Python
2. Learn Javascript (with some frameworks)
3. Learn HTML5, CSS3
3. Learn more Ruby and Rails.
4. Build cool projects (here).
