RKClient

## Deletage
Where do we send responses of requests? A RKClient 

protocol => I'm going to implement these set of actions. I expect you (the delegate) to respond a certain set of actions.

It's not an actual class. 


### The Event Loop!!
Your program is always within this event loop.

	waitingforuserinteraction => actions => more code => update the view => waiting for user interaction

Never do anything in this event thread that will take a long time because it'll hurt the user experience and create a qeuee of events. If the event gets long enough, it'll start dropping events. 

Creating a new ui can create another worker that can work in parallel with the main thread.
