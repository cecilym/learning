eg. printf debugging. One way to go about debigging is with a bunch of NSLogs.

Another way is to use XCode break points.

llvm - the name of the compiler
lldb - the name of the debugger (like pry or irb in ruby).

use po for printing out things in the xcode console.

The o is for object. When we want to print out a primative (eg an integer), use p, followed by the type that's a cast.

	p (int) [[self items] count]

If your app crashes (you get the green arrow), you'll get post-mortem information. 

But if you go to the breakpoints tab (command + 6), and add an exception breakpoint (from the lower left corner).

If you have a breakpoint in lldb, you can call the method n to step through your program line by line.
