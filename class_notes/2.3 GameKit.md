# GameKit

Peer to Peer:
Allows you to connect to devices near you. There's no server involved.

Bandwidth vs. Latency

Bluetooth: low bandwidth. A slowchannel. The time from the initial send to the initial receive of data. Good for sending small amounts of data.


You have to change your data to an NSData, because GameKit is low level.

In [Ned's Example](https://github.com/ruggeri/GameKitDemo/blob/master/GameKitDemo/GameViewController.m), 

In GKSession, we hard code two things:
1. Display Name
2. Session id. You only connect with people with the same GKSession ID. 
- dataReceiveHandler = self
- delegate = self
- availabke = YES. I'm available for connections.
