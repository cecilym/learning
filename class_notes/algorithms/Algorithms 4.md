# Tree traversals

Trees are a type of _graph_
- A graph has vertices and edges that connect to other graphs.
	- Example: A web graph of sites pointing to each other.

A tree is a graph where parents point to children and not back up again. 

Example Problem: Given a knight on a position, can a knight get to some other given poisition. Known as Game tree.
	- This isn't a proper tree, however, because people can move back. 
	- Each time you explore another node in the tree, leave a mark of the previous node that you've been to (to avoid making a very recursive algorithm).
