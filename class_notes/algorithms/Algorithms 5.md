# Maze Solver

1. Make a Maze (use ruby)
	- With a position = { x: 1, y:1} for example.
	- With a path, an array of positions. As I extend the path, extend this array. 
	- Make the grid a square. With a maze size (start with 2x2)
	- Walls = an hash with pairs of positions. 
2. Use depth-first search.
