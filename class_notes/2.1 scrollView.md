# ScrollView

When you have too much content to cover in the iphone.


The content in the scrollview may actually be much larger than 320 by 480 points. Scrollview has a property called content size.

The size of the frame of the scrollView starts at the top left and goes for the size of the iphone screen. 

When you set the property content size, you set bounds. The size will be (320, 480). The origin of the bounds changes as you move. Fortunetly, this is handles automatically by scrollView.

To pinch and zoom, set minimumZoomScale and maximumZoomScale.
